            "Format": "The tournament is a single-elimination competition featuring 68 teams. Teams qualify by winning their conference championship (automatic bid) or by selection from a committee (at-large bid).",
            "The Bracket": "The 68 teams are divided into four regions and seeded 1 through 16 within each region. Matches are based on seeding, with #1 seeds playing #16 seeds, #2 seeds playing #15 seeds, and so on.",
            "Unpredictability and Cinderella Stories": "The single-elimination format creates an environment prone to upsets and unexpected runs by lower-seeded teams, known as \"Cinderellas\". This unpredictability is a major part of the tournament's appeal.",
            "Cultural Phenomenon": "March Madness extends beyond sports, becoming a cultural phenomenon with widespread engagement in bracket challenges, office pools, and viewing parties. It generates significant revenue through media rights, advertising, and tourism. The term was first used in reference to basketball by an Illinois high school official, Henry V. Porter, in 1939 but only became synonymous with the NCAA tournament after CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger used it in 1982. ",
            "Key Rounds": "The tournament progresses through several rounds, including the First Four, the Sweet Sixteen, the Elite Eight, and the Final Four, before culminating in the championship game."
