            "Teams": "Two teams compete, each with 11 players on the field at a time, though rosters are much larger to account for specialized offensive, defensive, and special teams units. ",
            "Objective": "The goal is to score more points than the opposing team within the allotted time. Points are scored by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone for a touchdown (6 points), or by kicking it through the uprights for a field goal (3 points).",
            "Advancing the Ball": "The team with possession (offense) has four chances, called downs, to advance the ball at least 10 yards. This can be done by running or passing the ball. If successful, they earn a new set of downs. If they fail, possession is turned over to the opposing team.",
            "Time": "An NFL game consists of four 15-minute quarters, separated by a 12-minute halftime break. While the official game clock is 60 minutes, the average NFL game lasts around three hours due to various stoppages such as timeouts, penalties, and replay reviews.",
            "Entertainment": "NFL games are a major form of entertainment, with a large and passionate fan base. ",
            "Competition": "The NFL is highly competitive, with 32 teams vying for a chance to reach the Super Bowl. "
